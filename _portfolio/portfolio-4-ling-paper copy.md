title: "Tracing Theories of Meaning Representation"
excerpt: "This paper examines two approaches to meaning representation: formal semantics, a logic-based model-theoretic perspective on meaning, and distributional semantics, a structural, statistical approach. We explore their linguistic origins, their treatment of semantic phenomena, and whether or how they should be resolved in the context of the broader linguistic landscape."

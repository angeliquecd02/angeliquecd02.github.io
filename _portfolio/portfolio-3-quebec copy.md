title: "Understanding Québecois French Style-shifting Through the Speech of Céline Dion"
excerpt: "This is a small phonetic study of the speech patterns of Céline Dion, one of Quebec’s most well-known celebrities, across two interviews from her career: one given in a Metropolitan French environment, and one given in a Quebecois French environment. We examine the linguistic phenomenon of laxing, a compulsory yet variable practice in Quebecois French, in order to compare its production in the two environments."

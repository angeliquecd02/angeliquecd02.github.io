I graduated from Stanford University in 2025 with a coterminal M.S. in Computer Science, with a concentration in Theoretical Computer Science. Prior to that, I earned my B.S. from Stanford in Symbolic Systems, with a concentration in Natural Language, along with a minor in Modern Languages (French and Spanish). 

Currently I am in the tech industry world, where I am thrilled to soon be starting as a Software Engineer at [Abridge](https://www.abridge.com/).

I am interested in how linguistic meaning is represented in minds and machines. My research lies at the intersection of computational linguistics, sociophonetics, and psycholinguistics. I use modeling and computational approaches to understand how both humans and language models wrestle with meaning, with a focus on the emergence of social meaning. Currently, I am working to understand how and to what extent speech encoders represent socially salient phonetic features.

If any of that sounds interesting to you please feel free to reach out! I can be reached at angelcd at alumni dot stanford dot edu

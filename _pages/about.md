I am a coterminal M.S. student at Stanford University studying Computer Science, with a concentration in Theoretical Computer Science. In June of 2024, I earned my B.S. in Symbolic Systems, with a concentration in Natural Language, along with a minor in Modern Languages (French and Spanish). I am broadly interested in how linguistic meaninng is captured in minds and machines.

I graduated from Stanford University in 2025 with a coterminal M.S. in Computer Science, with a concentration in Theoretical Computer Science. Prior to that, I earned my B.S. from Stanford in Symbolic Systems, with a concentration in Natural Language, along with a minor in Modern Languages (French and Spanish). 

Currently I am in the tech industry world, where I am thrilled to soon be starting as a Software Engineer at Abridge.

My research focuses on the intersection of computational linguistics and sociophonetics, with a particular interest in how automatic speech recognition models encode fine-grained phonetic variation. I am interested in probing neural speech representations to understand how dialectal and social factors are captured, and in connecting these model-based findings to human perceptual patterns. More broadly, I aim to leverage computational tools to study language variation and human linguistic perception in diverse speech communities.

If any of that sounds interesting to you please feel free to reach out! I can be reached at angelcd at alumni dot stanford dot edu
